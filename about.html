                <p>Getting big or boom in this fashio
                   industry may be daunting. It's an extremely competitive industry or I
                    call it <b>world</b> where cool 
                    creative designers have to work together to keep up with rapidly changing trends and a demanding audience who are spoilt for choice. That being said, fashion careers can be very tasking to any fashionista .The incentive behind those
                    whose love for the fashion industry is only paralleled by their determination and dedication to leave their
                    mark on it. I've been in this fashion industry for good four years now.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    There may be some fashion environments that are brutal, but, you have to keep on moving don't stop, resilience has been my watch word since my first time in this industry, craving to become large some, but can't do it alone I need the support of customers/clients to patronize, so we can be big. You'll also be proud to have a big, great and famous fashion designer,(yes or no)?, Thanks
